# Uncertainty Evaluation Service

Exact, rational-arithmetic uncertainty propagation for metrology workflows.
Given 1–24 input quantities (measurement value + sensitivity), a covariance
matrix of the same order, an intercept, and a non-negative variance budget,
the service computes

```
estimate = intercept + Σᵢ cᵢ·xᵢ
variance = cᵀ Σ c
```

Optionally, 1–4 reference observations from a shared calibration source
condition the result before release.  With observation coefficients H,
observed values z and reference noise covariance R, the joint linear model
gives the exact conditional estimate and variance

```
estimate′ = estimate + βᵀ M⁻¹ (z − H x)
variance′ = variance − βᵀ M⁻¹ β
M = H Σ Hᵀ + R,  β = H Σ c
```

`M` may be singular (redundant or noiseless references make it degenerate).
The service then solves `M y = β` and `M w = z − H x` exactly instead of
inverting `M`; `β` always lies in the column space of `M`, so the
conditional result is still unique whenever the observations are mutually
consistent.

**All arithmetic is exact** (`fractions.Fraction`). No floating point value is
ever produced on the decision path, so the budget verdict cannot be shifted
by rounding or tolerance tricks.

## API

### `POST /api/uncertainty/evaluate`

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {"id": "x1", "value": "3/2",  "sensitivity": "2"},
    {"id": "x2", "value": "-1/4", "sensitivity": "1/3"}
  ],
  "covariance": [["1/4", "1/8"], ["1/8", "1/2"]],
  "intercept": "1/2",
  "variance_budget": "2"
}
```

* `inputs` — array of **1 to 24** entries, evaluated in order. Each entry has
  a unique non-empty string `id`, a rational `value` and a rational
  `sensitivity`.
* `covariance` — `n × n` array matching the input order. Must be exactly
  symmetric and positive semidefinite (checked exactly via LDLᵀ).
* `intercept` — rational.
* `variance_budget` — rational, must be **≥ 0**.
* `conditioning` — **optional** object with reference observations (see
  below). When omitted, the verdict is exactly the unconditioned one.

### Optional `conditioning`

```json
"conditioning": {
  "observations": [
    {"id": "r1", "value": "2", "coefficients": {"x1": "1"}}
  ],
  "covariance": [["1/4"]]
}
```

* `observations` — array of **1 to 4** entries. Each entry has a unique
  non-empty string `id`, a rational observed `value`, and `coefficients`: a
  **non-empty** object mapping existing input ids to rationals (row of H;
  inputs not listed have coefficient 0).
* `covariance` — `m × m` reference noise covariance (R) for the `m`
  observations. Must be exactly symmetric and positive semidefinite.

The joint observation covariance `M = H Σ Hᵀ + R` does **not** need to be
invertible.  When it is singular but the degenerate observations are
mutually consistent — the residual `z − H x` lies in the column space of
`M` — the conditional estimate and variance are still uniquely determined
and the request succeeds.  The request is rejected
(`CONDITIONING_SINGULAR`) only when the observations contradict each other
or no unique conditional result exists.  Any reference-observation error
yields a stable error code and field path and never a release verdict.

**Rational format** (applies everywhere): a JSON integer (`3`, `"-7"`) or a
string `"p/q"` in **lowest terms** with a **positive** denominator
(`"3/4"`, `"5/1"`). Decimals, floats, booleans, unreduced fractions
(`"2/4"`) and non-positive denominators (`"1/0"`, `"1/-2"`) are rejected.

### Success — `200`

```json
{"estimate": "41/12", "variance": "11/9", "exceeds_budget": false}
```

`estimate` and `variance` are rendered in canonical reduced form;
`exceeds_budget` is `true` iff `variance > variance_budget` (exact
comparison; equality is *within* budget).

### Errors — `400` (also `404`/`405`/`413`)

```json
{"error": {"code": "COVARIANCE_NOT_SYMMETRIC",
           "message": "covariance[0][1] = 1/8 differs from covariance[1][0] = 1/6",
           "field": "covariance[0][1]"}}
```

Error responses never contain `estimate`/`variance`/`exceeds_budget`, so a
failed request can never be mistaken for a release decision.

| Code | Meaning |

| `MALFORMED_JSON` | Body is not valid JSON (incl. `NaN`/`Infinity`) |
| `INVALID_SCHEMA` | Structural problem (missing field, wrong type, input count outside 1–24, duplicate/empty id, malformed conditioning block, observation count outside 1–4, empty coefficients) |

| `CONDITIONING_SINGULAR` | The reference observations are mutually contradictory (degenerate `H Σ Hᵀ + R` with the residual `z − H x` outside its column space) or otherwise do not determine a unique conditional result |
| `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` | Body exceeds 1 MiB (HTTP 413) |
| `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` | Wrong HTTP method (HTTP 405) |

### `GET /healthz`

Returns `200 {"status": "ok"}` once the server accepts requests; used by the
Compose health check.

## Run with Docker Compose

```sh
docker compose up --build api          # serves on http://localhost:8000
API_PORT=9000 docker compose up --build api   # host port is configurable
```

The `api` service health check polls `/healthz` until the container can
receive requests.

## One-shot verification

The `verify` service waits for `api` to be healthy, then runs the unit
tests, the application build (byte-compile + import check) and HTTP smoke
tests covering valid and invalid covariance matrices, requests without
conditioning (compatible), valid conditioning, redundant degenerate
reference combinations (accepted) and contradictory degenerate observations
(rejected). It prints a summary and exits with code 0 on success, 1 on
failure:

```sh
docker compose up --build --exit-code-from verify verify
docker compose down
```

## Local development (no dependencies, Python ≥ 3.10)

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -v        # tests
API_PORT=8000 python3 -m app.server    # run
```
